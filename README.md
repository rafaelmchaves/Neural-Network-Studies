Code produced during my Deep learning course in Coursera. Prof Andrew Ng

 - logistic_regression directory contains the implementation of logistic regression algorithm trying to identify if the image contains a cat or not.
 - deepnn directory has the implementation of a simple deep neural network with many layers.
 - Minibatch directory contains implementations of Adam, momentum and gradient descent algorithms using mini-batch.
